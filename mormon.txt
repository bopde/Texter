HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

NARRATOR
Long ago, in the year of our Lord, 326AD, a great prophet is leader of the Nephite people in ancient Upstate New York. His name... Is Mormon.

MORMON
I am Mormon. My people sailed here from Israel to create a new civilization. These golden plates tell of our people and how we met… with Jesus Christ.

JESUS
I am Jesus. Take care of your golden plates, Mormon, for soon, your entire civilization will be gone and nobody will remember you.

NARRATOR
Just before the Nephite people were wiped out, Mormon gave the plates to his son, Moroni.

MORONI
I am Moroni, the last of my kind. I shall BURY the golden plates, father, and perhaps one day; someone very special will find them…

NARRATOR
And Lo, Moroni buried the golden plates high on a hill.



Centuries later, the golden plates were found, giving birth to the fastest growing religion today!
A church that even now sends missionaries out… All over the world…

PRICE'S DAD
Ho! Don't worry son. Heavenly Father has a hand in everything. He knows what's best... He always knows!

ELDER PRICE
You're right dad... I'm sure I’m gonna have an amazing time.

CUNNINGHAM'S DAD
Alright, son, remember, just do whatever Elder Price tells you to do. He is a great Mormon. The kind of kid any parent would be proud of.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Right! I'm a FOLLOWER!

CUNNINGHAM'S DAD
That’s right. So do your best. And maybe your new companion will help you be not so weird.

Our little Arnold can sometimes be... Well... He has a very ACTIVE imagination.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
I LIE A LOT!

CUNNINGHAM'S DAD
NO! He-- He just sometimes MAKES THINGS UP when he doesn't know what to say.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Bishop Donahue says it's because I have no self esteem and desperately want to fit in with my peers!

PRICE'S DAD
Well, alright everyone!  I think its time we leave these two to their work! You boys have a lot of catching up to do now that you're companions! This is it, Elders. You're heading... TO AFRICA!!!!!

ELDER PRICE
Oh thank goodness! Some men just took our bags for!

MAFALA
Oh yes you must be very careful around here! Now let’s get going!

ELDER PRICE
Well, no, first shouldn't we talk to the police about getting our bags back?

MAFALA
The police?! Ha, Ha! The police are in Kampala! Two day’s drive away! !
 

ELDER PRICE
But there was a lot of important stuff in those bags!

MAFALA
Oh well, "Hasa Diga Eebowai”!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Excuse me?

MAFALA
You're in NORTHERN Uganda now! (Music) And in this part of Africa, we ALL have a saying -whenever something bad happens, we just throw our hands up to the sky and say HASA DIGA EEBOWAI!
.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Hasa Diga Eebowai?

MAFALA
It's the only way to get through all these troubled times. There's war, poverty, famine... but having a saying makes it all seem better...


THERE ISN'T ENOUGH FOOD TO EAT. HASA DIGA EEBOWAI!
PEOPLE ARE STARVING IN THE STREET.

 

HASA DIGA EEBOWAI! HASA DIGA EEBOWAI! HASA DIGA EEBOWAI!
 
UGANDANS & FATHER
 

ELDER PRICE
Hey, that's pretty neat!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Does it mean no worries for the rest of our days?

MAFALA
Kind of!

WE'VE HAD NO RAIN IN SEVERAL DAYS.

UGANDANS
HASA DIGA EEBOWAI!
 

MAFALA
AND EIGHTY PERCENT OF US HAVE AIDS.

UGANDANS
HASA DIGA EEBOWAI!

MAFALA
MANY YOUNG GIRLS HERE GET CIRCUMCISED WE CUT THEIR CLITS RIGHT OFF

ALL
WAY OH!

WOMEN AND SO WE SAY UP TO THE SKY

UGANDANS
HASA DIGA EEBOWAI! HASA DIGA EEBOWAI! HASA DIGA EEBOWAI!

MAFALA
Now you try. Just stand up tall, tilt your head to the sky, and list off all the bad things in YOUR life.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM SOMEBODY TOOK OUR LUGGAGE AWAY!

UGANDANS
HASA DIGA EEBOWAI!

ELDER PRICE
THE PLANE WAS CROWDED AND THE BUS WAS LATE!

UGANDANS
HASA DIGA EEBOWAI!

MAFALA
WHEN THE WORLD IS GETTING YOU DOWN, THERE'S NOBODY ELSE TO BLAME.

UGANDANS
WAY OH!
 

MAFALA RAISE A MIDDLE FINGER TO THE SKY, AND CURSE HIS ROTTEN NAME.

ELDER PRICE
Wait, what?

 

HASA DIGA EEBOWAI!

Am I saying it right?
 
ELDER CUNNINGHAM
 


ELDER CUNNINGHAM AND UGANDANS
HASA DIGA EEBOWAI!

ELDER PRICE
Excuse me, what EXACTLY does that phrase mean?

FATHER
Well, let's see... “Eebawai” means 'God', and ‘Hasa Diga’ means 'FUCK YOU'. So I guess in English it would be, 'Fuck you, God!'

UGANDANS
HASA DIGA EEBOWAI!

ELDER PRICE
What?!!

FATHER WHEN GOD FUCKS YOU IN THE BUTT.

UGANDANS
HASA DIGA EEBOWAI!

FATHER FUCK GOD BACK RIGHT IN HIS CUNT!

UGANDANS
HASA DIGA EEBOWAI!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
HASA DIGA EEBOWAI! WHAT A NIFTY PHRASE!
 

UGANDANS

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
HASA DIGA EEBOWAI! HASA DIGA EEBOWAI! HASA DIGA EEBOWAI!

ELDER PRICE
Elder Cunningham. Elder Cunningham. Stop- Elder Cunningham. ELDER CUNNINGHAM!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
What, what, what?

ELDER PRICE
You have to stop saying that!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
What? Hasa Diga--

ELDER PRICE
It means something very bad.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
What?

ELDER PRICE
They’re saying F you to Heavenly Father!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
F you to Heavenly Father?! Holy Moly! I said it like thirteen times!

UGANDANS
HASA DIGA EEBOWAI! FUCK YOU, GOD!
HASA DIGA EEBOWAI! FUCK YOU, GOD!
 

ELDER PRICE
Excuse me sir, you really should not be saying that. Things aren't always as bad as they seem.

MUFALA
Oh really? Take this fucking asshole, Mutumbo. He got caught last week trying to rape a baby.

ELDER PRICE
What!? Why?

MUFALA
Some people in his tribe believe having sex with a virgin will cure their aids. There aren’t many virgins left, so some of them are turning to babies.

ELDER PRICE
But…. But… That’s horrible!

MUFALA
I know!

UGANDANS
HASA DIGA EEBOWAI!

MUFALA HERE'S THE BUTCHER, HE HAS AIDS. HERE IS THE TEACHER, SHE HAS AIDS. HERE IS THE DOCTOR, HE HAS AIDS – HERE IS MY DAUGHTER, SHE HAS A...

WONDERFUL DISPOSITION.
SHE’S ALL I HAVE LEFT IN THE WORLD.
AND IF EITHER OF YOU LAYS A HAND ON HER – I WILL GIVE YOU MY AIDS.

UGANDANS IF YOU DON'T LIKE WHAT WE SAY
TRY LIVING HERE A COUPLE DAYS.
WATCH ALL YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY DIE. HASA DIGA EEBOWAI!
FUCK YOU!
 


FUCK! THIS!

HASA DIGA EEBOWAI!

FUCK YOU GOD IN THE ASS, MOUTH, AND CUNT –A FUCK YOU GOD IN THE ASS, MOUTH, AND CUNT –A FUCK YOU GOD IN THE ASS, MOUTH, AND CUNT – A FUCK YOU IN THE EYE

HASA –
DIGA EEBOWAI! HASA -

FUCK YOU FUCK YOU GOD FUCK YOU FUCK YOU GOD FUCK YOU FUCK YOU GOD


HASA DIGA! FUCK YOU GOD IN THE CUNT!








FUCK YOU GOD!
 

4a: MORMON MISSION EXTERIOR




NABULUNGI
This is where my father asked me to bring you. The others like you should be inside.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Thank you very much, Jon Bon Jovi.

NABULUNGI
Nabulungie.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Nab.. Bon Jovi.

ELDER PRICE
I'm sorry, we really appreciate your help, Nabulungi. Look, uh, maybe sometime, Elder Cunningham and I could talk to you. Maybe we could, uh, tell you a little about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

NABULUNGI
I have to get back to the village. But I am always there if you want to talk. Just one piece of advice. No matter how hot you get at night, keep your windows closed. It is the only way to protect against the scorpions	And the mosquitoes. And the Lions. And the
murderers and the robbers and the AIDS and the snakes and the safari ants which can actually plant their eggs underneath your skin and eat you from inside out.

ELDER PRICE
Oh man, Elder, can you believe this?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
I know... She is such a hot shade of black, right? She's like a latte.

ELDER PRICE
Let's just go inside and meet the other elders, alright?

ELDER CHURCH (BRIAN)
WHEN I WAS YOUNG,

ELDERS

ELDER MCKINLEY

Now how do you feel?

ELDER PRICE
The same.

ELDER MCKINLEY THEN YOU'VE ONLY GOT YOURSELF TO BLAME. YOU DIDN'T PRETEND HARD ENOUGH.
IMAGINE THAT YOUR BRAIN IS MADE OF TINY BOXES THEN FIND THE BOX THAT'S GAY AND CRUSH IT!!

ELDERS
Alright! /Yea! /Great job guys! /Etc.

ELDER MCKINLEY
Alright Elders, alright-- Our two new missionaries must be EXHAUSTED from all their travels. Let's show them their room. A 6, 7, 8.
 

ELDER MCKINLEY

Ta Da!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
ALRIGHT! CHECK IT OUT!! WE GETTA SLEEP RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER!!!

ELDER MCKINLEY
All right Elders. Get settled in, and according to the missionary rules lights out promptly at ten and we all wake UP at exactly 6:30. We've heard a lot of great things about you, Elder Price. Really hoping you can turn things around here.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Don’t worry we will!

ELDER MCKINLEY
Elders... We're glad you're here.

ELDER PRICE
ZERO baptisms? This is going to be a WHOLE LOT harder than we thought, huh?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Yeah! This is gonna be a lot like Lord of the Rings! You’re Frodo and I’m Samwise fighting against impossible odds!

ELDER PRICE
This just all isn’t what I was expecting. I’ve gotta admit, I’m beginning to start to feel… I don’t wanna say ‘ripped off’ but just… overwhelmed.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Well I’ve got something to admit too… Remember when I told you that I sometimes make things up, and Bishop Donahue said it’s because I have no self esteem and desperately want to fit in with my peers?

ELDER PRICE
Yeah?
 

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
It’s not true. There is no Bishop Donahue. I made him up.

ELDER PRICE
Elder, I really think you should just think about the big day we have ahead tomorrow, ok? Remember why we are here. Can you do that for me?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
I would do anything for you - I'm your best friend.

ELDER PRICE
Alright, well, let's get to sleep, huh?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Yeah!
I’m so tired.
SLEEP NOW LITTLE BUDDY, PUT YOUR CARES AWAY. NAPPY WITH A HAPPY FACE TOMORROW’S A LATTER DAY -

ELDER PRICE
What are you doing?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
That’s what my mom used to sing to me to make me feel better.

ELDER PRICE
I feel FINE. But Elder, our focus needs to be on our WORK. Do you understand how difficult this is going to be? The missionaries here have yet to bring a SINGLE PERSON the church.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Well if they had already baptized a bunch of Africans here, then it wouldn't be so incredible when YOU did it, now would it?

ELDER PRICE
I guess... I guess that's kind of true...

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Don’t forget what you told me, Elder. You are AWESOME. Together we’re gonna bring lots of Africans to the church. And then my dad will finally feel proud of me – instead of just feeling ‘stuck’ with me…

ELDER PRICE
You know what, Elder? I think your dad’s got plenty to be proud of already.
 

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Really?!

EDLER PRICE
Yeah.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM EVENING STAR SHINES BRIGHTLY
GOD MAKES LIFE A NEW. TOMORROW IS A LATTER DAY I AM HERE FOR YOU.

ELDER PRICE I AM HERE FOR YOU TOO.

 

WE ARE HERE. FOR US.
 
ELDER CUNNINGHAM & ELDER PRICE
 

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Goodnight best friend.

ELDER PRICE
Goodnight, PAL.
 
6a: UGANDAN VILLAGE





UGANDANS HEY NAH HEYY AHH... HAYAAAA...
HEY NAH HEYY HASA DIGA….

MAFALA
Nabulungi! Where have you been?

NABULUNGI
Baba! Look what I got at the market!

MAFALA
What have I told you about wandering off? The market is NOT SAFE!

NABULUNGI
But Baba I finally found one! A TEXTING device! Now I can text all my friends!

MAFALA
Listen to me! Do not go to the market again! The General is MUTILATING girls in the next village over!

NABULUNGI
Baba, I’m sorry.

MUFALA
Nabulungi if we want to stay alive our village needs to LAY LOW and not attract any attention.

BOTH ELDERS TWO BY TWO WE MARCH FROM DOOR TO DOOR!
CUZ GOD LOVES MORMONS AND HE WANTS SOME MORE!
 


ELDER PRICE
Okay, why don’t you let ME do the talking, alright? You just sort of... SUPPORT what I'm talking about by going 'Oh wow' and stuff like that.


ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Right, right! Like one of those INFOMERCIALS that always says ‘wow what an incredible offer!’ I’m like THAT lady.

ELDER PRICE
Okay yes. Whatever. Why don't we start with this little house. Just walk up and do it like at the missionary training center.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Okay!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
OH NO!!! There's no doorbell!

ELDER PRICE
What?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
THEY'VE GOT NO DOORBELLS!!! WHAT DO WE DO WHAT DO WE DO!?!?!?

ELDER PRICE
CALM DOWN!

UGANDAN WOMAN
What is this noise?!
 

ELDER PRICE
Oh Hello ma'am! Dou you ever feel that there’s something missing in your life? When you go to bed at night do you sometimes feel a power STIRRING inside you?

MAN (MICHAEL JAMES)
Yes! That’s how I feel!

ELDER PRICE
Alright YOU sir! Come on down here. Do you find yourself asking questions about that strange feeling inside?

MAN
YES!

ELDER PRICE
And it’s because you want to believe in something else isn’t it?

MAN
No, It’s because I have maggots in my scrotum.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
YOU’VE GOT WHAT?

UGANDAN MAN (MICHAEL)
I have maggots in my scrotum! Can you help?

ELDER PRICE
Wul, no you should probably see a doctor.

UGANDAN MAN
I AM the doctor.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
What do we do? What do we do? What do we do?

ELDER PRICE
Don’t worry! Don’t worry! I got this! Uh... Yes... ladies and gentlemen. We would like to tell you ALL about a VERY SPECIAL BOOK that teaches you how to find PARADISE. Through Christ!
 


UGANDANS
Awww...

NABULUNGI
They've HEARD of the bible. We ALL have.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Bon Bon Jovi Hey girl.

NABULUNGI
People come and tell us about Jesus and him dying for our sins once a year!

UGANDAN WOMAN (MAIA)
They always come, tell us the story and then leave. And nothing gets better. Your BIBLE doesn't work.

ELDER PRICE
Well, of COURSE it didn't work. Those were CHRISTIAN missionaries. We're MORMONS.

NABULUNGI
What's the difference?


ELDER PRICE

YOU ALL KNOW THE BIBLE IS MADE OF TESTAMENTS OLD AND NEW
YOU’VE BEEN TOLD IT’S JUST THOSE TWO PARTS, OR ONLY ONE IF YOU’RE A JEW.
BUT WHAT IF WE’RE TO TELL YOU – THERE’S A FRESH THIRD PART OUT THERE WHICH WAS FOUND BY HIP NEW PROPHET WHO HAD A LITTLE

DONNY OSMOND FLAIR


ELDER CUNNINGHAM

WOO HOO!
 


ELDER PRICE
HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE ALL AMERICAN PROPHET? THE BLONDE- HAIRED BLUE-EYED VOICE OF GOD!
HE DIDN’T COME FROM THE MIDDLE EAST LIKE THOSE OTHER HOLY MEN
GOD’S FAVORITE PROPHET WAS ALL AMERICAN


I'm gonna take you back to biblical times: 1823. An American man named Joe livin' on a farm in the Holy Land of Rochester, New York!


ELDER CUNNINGHAM
You mean the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith?!

ELDER PRICE
That’s right! That young man spoke to God!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
He spoke to God?!

ELDER PRICE
And God said 'Joe people really need to know that the Bible isn't TWO parts - there's a part three to The Bible, Joe! And I, God, have anointed you... To dig up this part three which is buried by a tree on the hill in your backyard!'

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Wow! God says go to your backyard and start digging that makes perfect sense!

ELDER PRICE JOSEPH SMITH WENT UP ON THAT HILL AND HE DUG WHERE HE WAS TOLD!
DEEP IN THE GROUND JOSEPH FOUND SHINING PLATES OF GOLD!

JOSEPH SMITH
What are these golden plates? Who buried them here and why?

ELDER PRICE
Then appeared an angel - His name was MORO-NI!
 


 
MORONI (RORY)

I am Mornoni
THE ALL AMERICAN ANGEL


MY PEOPLE LIVED HERE LONG, LONG AGO!


THIS IS A HISTORY OF MY RACE PLEASE READ THE WORDS WITH IN

WE WERE JEWS WHO MET WITH CHRIST. BUT WE WERE

ALL AMERICAN
 
OFF STAGE VOCALS AHHHHH –


OSV & PRICE & CUNNINGHAM ALL AMERICAN


OFF STAGE VOCALS LONG AGOOOO-



WE WERE JEWS WHO MET WITH CHRIST. BUT WE WERE
ALL AMERICAN
 

 

BUT DON’T LET ANYBODY SEE THESE PLATES EXCEPT FOR YOU
 
MORONI
 
THEY ARE ONLY FOR YOU TO SEE
EVEN IF PEOPLE ASK YOU TO SHOW THE PLATES TO THEM, DON’T
JUST COPY THEM ON TO NORMAL PAPER
EVEN THOUGH THIS MIGHT MAKE THEM QUESTION IF THE PLATES ARE REAL OR NOT.
THIS IS SORT OF WHAT GOD IS GOING FOR…

ELDER PRICE JOSEPH TOOK THE PLATES HOME
AND WROTE DOWN WHAT HE FOUND INSIDE. HE TURNED THOSE PLATES INTO A BOOK, THEN RUSHED INTO TOWN AND CRIED:

JOSEPH SMITH
HEY! GOD SPOKE TO ME
AND GAVE ME THIS BLESSED ANCIENT TOME HE HATH COMMANDED ME TO PUBLISH IT AND STICK IT IN EV’RY HOME.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Wow! So the Bible is actually a trilogy, and Book of Mormon is Return of the Jedi?! I’M interested.
 
ELDER PRICE
Now, many people didn't BELIEVE the prophet Joseph Smith. They thought he'd made up this part three that was buried by a tree on a hill in his backyard.

TOWNSPEOPLE
LIAR!

ELDER PRICE
But Joe said-

JOSEPH SMITH
THIS IS NO LIE,
I SPEAK TO GOD ALL THE TIME AND HE'S TOLD ME TO HEAD WEST! SO I'LL TAKE MY PART THREE FROM THE HILL BY THE TREE,
FEEL FREE IF YOU'D LIKE TO COME ALONG WITH ME TO THE PROMISED LAND!

TOWNSPEOPLE
The PROMISED LAND?!

JOSEPH SMITH
Paradise! On the West coast!
NOTHING BUT FRUIT AND FIELDS AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE!

ALL
HAVE YOU HEARD OF
THE ALL AMERICAN PROPHET?
HE FOUND A BRAND NEW BOOK ABOUT JESUS CHRIST?
 

ALL
WE’RE FOLLOWING HIM TO PARADISE, WE CALL OURSELVES MORMEN,
AND OUR NEW RELIGION IS - ALL AMERICAN.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Wow! How much does all this cost?!

ELDER PRICE THE MORMONS KEPT ON SEARCHING FOR THAT PLACE TO SETTLE DOWN
BUT EV’RY TIME THEY THOUGHT THEY FOUND IT THEY GOT KICKED OUT OF TOWN
AND EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE WANTED TO SEE THE GOLDEN PLATES
JOSEPH NEVER SHOWED ‘EM!

UGANDAN (MJS) I HAVE MAGGOTS IN MY SCROTUM

ELDER PRICE
Well… Anyway -


 
ELDER PRICE
NOW COMES THE PART OF OUR STORY
THAT GETS A LITTLE BIT SAD. ON THE WAY TO THE PROMISED LAND,
MORMONS MADE PEOPLE MAD. JOSEPH WAS SHOT BY AN ANGRY MOB
AND KNEW HE’D SOON BE DONE
 
TOWNSPEOPLE OOOOOO –
OOOO -


AHH

KNEW HE’D SOON BE DONE
 


JOSEPH SMITH
YOU MUST LEAD THE PEOPLE NOW MY GOOD FRIEND BRIGHAM YOUNG

OH GOD WHY ARE YOU LETTING ME DIE
WITHOUT HAVING ME SHOW PEOPLE THE PLATES? THEY’LL HAVE NO PROOF
I WAS TELLING THE TRUTH OR NOT
THEY’LL HAVE TO BELIEVE IT JUST CUZ. OH
I GUESS THAT’S KIND OF WHAT YOU WERE GOING FOR. BLARGGGH

ELDER PRICE
The prophet Joseph Smith died for what he believed in. But his followers, they kept heading west. And Brigham Young lead them to paradise. A sparkling land in Utah they called Salt Lake City.


 
ELDER PRICE

And there the Mormons multiplied! And made big Mormon families!! Generation to generation until finally they made ME!!!
And now it’s my JOB, TO LEAD YOU WHERE THOSE EARLY SETLERS WERE LEAD SO LONG AGO!!!
 

TOWNSPEOPLE & CUNNINGHAM HOOOOOO –
HOOOO - AHH
 

ALL
HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE ALL AMERICAN PROPHET?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Kevin Price!!!

ALL
THE NEXT IN LINE TO BE THE VOICE OF GOD?!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
My best friend!

MORMONS
HE’S GONNA DO SOMETHING INCREDIBLE! AND BE JOSEPH SMITH A-GAIN!
CUZ’ KEVIN PRICE THE PROPHET IS ALLLLL – ALL AMERICAN


ELDER CUNNINGHAM

ALL

ELDER PRICE
So - who would like their very own copy of the Book of Mormon?!

UGANDAN (Asmeret)
What the fuck is a steak knife?

ELDER PRICE
What were you doing?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
I was just doing my part!

ELDER PRICE
THERE’S NOTHING IN THE BOOK OF MORMON ABOUT STEAK KNIVES!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
I’m sorry. I never actually read it.

PRICE
You what!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
It’s just so boring.

GENERAL
JUMAMOSI!!!!!

SADAKA (DARLESIA)
He's here! The General! He’s here!!

THE GENERAL (BRIAN TYREE)
What is THIS? Some kind of a party? And no one invited me?! MY NAME... Is GENERAL BUTT-FUCKING NAKED. Because when I KILL… AND DRINK
BLOOD FOR POWER – I DO IT BUTT FUCKING NAKED!!!! This village belongs to me.

UGANDAN MAN (LAWRENCE)
We don’t belong to anyone! You only lead a gang of THUGS who mutilate women for no reason!
 
THE GENERAL
For no REASON! The clit-tours… Is an ABOMINATION. It’s wicked pleasure for women has brought a WRATH UPON UGANDA AND it must be cast out!

UGANDAN MAN (LAWRENCE)
My wife’s body is none of your business! And YOU… are no ‘General’.

THE GENERAL
By the end of the week all females in this village will be circumcised. Or I WILL GET BUTT FUCKING NAKED AND DO THIS!!!
 
7a: NABULUGI’S HUT EXTERIOR


MAFALA
Alright, I think he’s gone. You have to stay indoors, Nabulungi! Keep the light off and the windows closed!

NABULUNGI

ELDER MCKINLEY O - M GOSH! YOU GUYS I’M FREAKING OUT!!!

ELDER NEELEY (JASON)
What is it?

ELDER MCKINLEY
I just got off the phone with the Zone Leader. The MISSION PRESIDENT wants a WRITTEN PROGRESS REPORT from us THIS WEEK!

ELDER (CLARK)
A progress report?! But we don't have any baptisms!!!!

ELDER MCKINLEY I KNOW THAT! WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?!

ELDERS
We're gonna get sent home!/This is terrible! / OH GOSH OH NO! / My dad's gonna beat me!/etc.

ELDER CHURCH (BRIAN)
Ok, ok HOLD ON! I mean… We COULD just… SAY that we had some baptisims.

ELDER MCKINLEY
What, you mean LIE?

ELDER CHURCH (BRIAN)
Well just sort of.

ELDER SCHRADER (BEN)
Are you an IDIOT?! Mormons don’t LIE!

ELDER NEELEY (KEVIN)
I told a lie once when I was twelve, and I had a dream that I went to hell! It was really spooky.
 
ELDER THOMAS (SCOTT)
You too?! I had the hell dream after I accidentally read a Playboy.

ELDER MCKINLEY
Look, we’ve ALL had the spooky hell dream, people! I have it NIGHTLY! The issue NOW is what the heck am I supposed to tell the mission President?

ELDER CHURCH
Elder Price, what happened to YOU?

ELDER PRICE
AFRICA IS NOTHING LIKE 'LION KING' – I think that movie took a LOT of artistic license!!!!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
He's upset because we just saw a guy get shot in the face.


ELDERS
Oooh/ewww/that's not good/etc.

ELDER MCKINLEY
What?

ELDER PRICE
I cannot continue my mission this way! There's is absolutely NOTHING I can accomplish here!


ELDER MCKINLEY
Elder Price you cannot lose your cool on me now, we're about to get evaluated by the MISSION PRESIDENT!

ELDER PRICE
That’s it! The Mission President! I have to go see the Mission President and get transferred!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Buddy! Buddy! I know things seem tough right now. . But remember - - tomorrow is a LATTER DAY!
 

ELDER PRICE
‘Latter Day’ doesn’t mean tomorrow!!!! It means afterlife! The reckoning! The ‘Latter Days’ where all good people go to heavenly Father and get everything they’ve always wanted!!! I’m outta here!

ELDER MKLINLEY
Hey! HEY! Are you forgetting rule number twenty three?! You can NOT leave the living quarters after 9 pm!!

ELDER PRICE
To heck with rules! I'm not wasting the most important two years of my life!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Hey! Hey! Hold up you forgot me!

ELDER MCKINLEY
Elder Cunningham, do you ALSO want to break rule number twenty three?!


ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Oh NO! What am I supposed to do? According to rule number 23 I can’t leave the living quarters after curfew – but according to rule number 72 I can’t leave my companion alone! This like a matrix logic trick! Rule 23 – Rule 72– Rule 23 – I’M SORRY GUYS! HE’S MY BEST FRIEND!
 

9a: VILLAGE





ELDER CUNNINGHAM
HEY COME ON!! We’re supposed to be together at all times, remember?!

ELDER PRICE

ELDER PRICE
Yes it IS.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Okay…alright, If you want to transfer... then THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING!! I'm with you!

ELDER PRICE
I didn't say WE'RE transferring - I said I AM.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Oh... I see...

ELDER PRICE
Look, I'm sorry, but you and I just aren't that compatible, alright?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Well we just became best friends a few days ago!

ELDER PRICE
I'M NOT YOUR BEST FRIEND! I just got STUCK with you by the missionary training center. I didn't MEAN to say 'STUCK'... It's just that...

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Yeah, yeah no it's okay. I know how it goes. It's really fine. I'll be totally fine...
 

ELDER PRICE
Yes. You WILL be fine, we just need, you know, different things.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Right, different things.

ELDER PRICE
It was... nice meeting you.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Yeah. You too. Take it easy.

I don't have any friends.

NABULUNGI
No, no! I have written Elder Price a text. Here! It says to please come back to the village. We are ready!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
To do what?

NABULUNGI
To LISTEN to him! I texted everyone that we HAVE to give Elder Price a chance!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
I'm sorry, he's requested a transfer.

NABULUNGI
What is a transfer?!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
That means he'll be sent somewhere else.

NABULUNGI
No! He can't leave! We are ready to listen!
 

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
It's too late he's already made up his mind.

NABULUNGI
What about you?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Me? What?

NABULUNGI
He is gone. But you are still here. YOU will lead us. Teach us everything about what's in the Book of Mormon.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Me? No, no... I'm a FOLLOWER.

NABULUNGI
Everyone is waiting! Come back to the village and YOU WILL HAVE YOUR LISTENERS! I SWEAR IT!!!!

9a: “TIME TA MAN UP”

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
WHAT DID JESUS DO,
WHEN THEY SENTENCED HIM TO DIE? DID HE TRY TO RUN AWAY?
DID HE JUST BREAK DOWN AND CRY?

NO JESUS DUG DOWN DEEP, KNOWING WHAT HE HAD TO DO- WHEN FACED WITH HIS OWN DEATH, JESUS KNEW THAT HE HAD TO...

MAN UP.
HE HAD TO MAN UP.
SO HE CRAWLED UP ON THAT CROSS, AND HE STUCK IT OUT.
AND HE MANNED UP. CHRIST, HE MANNED UP.

WHEN THEY PUT NAILS THROUGH HIS HANDS?
DID HE SCREAM LIKE A GIRL OR DID HE TAKE IT LIKE A MAN: WHEN SOMEONE HAD TO DIE TO SAVE US FROM OUR SINS JESUS SAID 'I'LL DO IT' AND HE TOOK IT ON THE CHIN!

HE MANNED UP! AND HE MANNED UP.
AND TOOK A BULLET FOR ME AND YOU, THAT'S MAN UP.
REAL MAN UP.

BOOK OF MORMON ACT 2

10a: THE HILL CUMORAH



NARRATOR
And yea, it came to pass that the Prophet Joseph Smith discovered the Book of Mormon on golden plates. But what exactly is the Book of Mormon about?

It tells of two Hebrew tribes at war in ancient America – The gentle Nephites, and the wicked Lamanites. They fought many great battles, but then, just after his crucifixion, Christ appeared!

I am Jesus. I've just been crucified on the other side of the world you guys. I only have three days before I am resurrected, but in that time, I will preach here to you in America.

And LO, Christ told them many things, and a Nephite named Mormon wrote the teachings on plates of gold. Plates that became the book of Mormon! A book that is still today read by missionaries over the world!!!
 

11a: VILLAGE







ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Ah… And it came to pass that the NEPHITES had gathered together a great number of men, even to exceed the number of thirty thousand! Ooooo. Yeah. And it came to pass that in the same year they had a number of battles, in which the Nephites did beat the Lamanites and did slay many of them!

UGANDAN WOMAN (ASMERET)
So what the fuck does THAT mean?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Uh... That MEANS... You know... You should... Be NICE to each other or something. And Lo, the Lord was so displeased with the Laminites that he caused a cursing to come upon them. And wherefore as they were WHITE and delightsome, the Lord did cause a skin of BLACKNESS to come upon them! And thus they oooh - - - ugh… let’s skip that part, huh…

MAFALA
How is this supposed to make things better for us?! The General Butt Fucking Naked is going to come back and if he sees us here we are all DEAD.

NABULUNGI
Baba please, we just need to LISTEN.

UGANDAN MAN (LAWRENCE)
To WHAT?! THREE HOURS we’ve been listening to him talk about STUPID SHIT that happened on the other side of the earth thousands of years ago! It has nothing to do with us!

UGANDAN WOMAN (DARLESIA)
Yeah, yeah. And those "NEPHITES" probably didn't even have AIDS to deal with!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
SURE THEY DID! SURE THEY DID!! Back then people had even WORSE AIDS! Yeah! And LO! The Lord said unto the Nephites - I know you're really depressed, what with all your AIDS and everything... But there is an answer in Christ!
 

NABULUNGI
You see?! This book CAN help us!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
I JUST TOLD A LIE.
Wait, no I didn't lie...
I JUST USED MY IMAGINATION. AND IT WORKED!

CUNNINGHAM'S DAD (KEVIN) YOU'RE MAKING THINGS UP AGAIN ARNOLD.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
But it worked Dad.

CUNNINGHAM’S DAD YOU'RE STRETCHING THE TRUTH AGAIN,
AND YOU KNOW IT-



JOSEPH SMITH (LEWIS) DON'T BE A FIBBING FRAN, ARNOLD

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Joseph Smith?

SMITH & DAD (LEWIS, KEVIN)
BECAUSE A LIE IS A LIE.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
It's not a lie!

MORONI, MORMON, SMITH, DAD YOU'RE MAKING THINGS UP AGAIN ARNOLD!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Oh conscience!
 

MORONI, MORMON, SMITH, DAD YOU'RE TAKING THE HOLY WORD
AND ADDING FICTION!
BE CAREFUL HOW YOU PROCEED, ARNOLD. WHEN YOU FIB, THERE'S A PRICE.

MIDDALA (JOHN ERIC)
This is bullshit! The story I’VE been told is that the way to cure AIDS is by sleeping with a virgin! I'm going to go and rape a baby!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
WHAT!?!! OH MY--- NO! You can't do that! NO!!!!

MIDDALA
Why not?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Because that is DEFINITELY against God's will!

MIDDALA
Says who!? Where in that book of yours does it say ANYTHING about sleeping with a baby?! Nowhere!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Uhhh Behold! The Lord said to the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith, You shall not have sex with that infant! LO! Joseph said 'why not, Lord? Huh? Why not? And the Lord said if you lay with an infant you shall burn in the fiery pits of Mordour.

MIDDALA
Really?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Uh huh. Uh huh. A baby cannot cure your illness, Joseph Smith -- I shall give unto you... A FROG... And thus Joseph laid with the frog and his AIDS was no more!

UGANDANS
Ohhhhhh....
 

MORONI, MORMON, SMITH, DAD YOU'RE MAKING THINGS UP AGAIN ARNOLD.
YOU'RE RECKLESSLY WARPING THE WORDS OF JESUS!

HOBBITS (SCOTT, BRIAN) YOU CAN'T JUST SAY WHAT YOU WANT, ARNOLD.

 

Come on, Hobbits.
 
ELDER CUNNINGHAM

ALL
 
YOU'RE DIGGING YOURSELF A DEEP HOLE.


ELDER CUNNINGHAM I'M MAKING THINGS UP AGAIN, KIND OF!
BUT THIS TIME IT'S HELPING A DOZEN PEOPLE! ITS NOTHING SO BAD BECAUSE THIS TIME –
I'M NOT COMMITTING A SIN JUST BY MAKING THINGS UP AGAIN, RIGHT?!

MORONI, MORMON, SMITH, DAD, HOBBITS
NO

NABULUNGI
Elder Cunningham! You have to stop him!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
What? What is it?

NABULUNGI
Gotswana is going to cut off his daughter's clitoris!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
HAH?!

GOTSWANA (MICHAEL)
This is all very interesting, but women have to be circumcised if it’s what the General wants!


ELDER CUNNINGHAM
No, no, doing that to a lady is against Christ’s will!

GOTSWANA
How do you know? Christ never said nothin' about no clitoris!
 

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Yes! Yes he did! In ancient New York, three men were about to cut off a Mormon woman's clitoris! But right before they did- Jesus had Boba Fett turn them into FROGS!

GOTSWANA
Frogs?

UGANDAN (ASMERET)
You mean like the frogs that got fucked by Joseph Smith!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Yeah! Those Frogs! For a clitoris is holy amongst all things, said he!

MORONI, MORMON, SMITH, DAD, HOBBITS YOU'RE MAKING THINGS UP AGAIN, ARNOLD.

UGANDANS WE'RE LEARNING THE TRUTH!

CHORUS
YOU'RE TAKING THE HOLY WORD AND ADDING FICTION!

UGANDANS
THE TRUTH ABOUT GOD.

CHORUS
BE CAREFUL HOW YOU PROCEED, ARNOLD. WHEN YOU FIB THERE'S A PRICE.

UGANDANS WE'RE GOING TO PARADISE.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT I HAD THIS MAGIC TOUCH? WHO'DVE BELIEVED I COULD MAN UP THIS MUCH?

I think he's coming to! Come on, Elder Price... Wake up buddy...

ELDER PRICE
Wha--- What? Where am I?

ELDER (JASON)
Looks like you passed out at the bus station!

ELDER (BRIAN)
We were so worried!

ELDER PRICE
I’m sorry. I’m sorry I had a little meltdown last night, but I’m not leaving. YEAH, yeah… I… realized while I was asleep that it’s WRONG and I’ve got to stick to my work.

ELDER MCKINLEY
Ohh you had the Hell dream didn’t you?

ELDERS
Oho…

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
(Singing) Ba-dum-dum-dum-dumm-da-dum-Arnold! OH HEY GUYS!!

ELDER MICHAELS (CLARK)
Elder Cunningham! Where have YOU been?!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Oh nowhere much... Just with TEN eager Africans who are now interested in the church.
 


ELDERS
WHAT?! /Are you serious?! /Oh my God?! /Etc.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Yup... Yup they're all completely into the teachings and willing to learn more!

ELDER PRICE
Are you serious, Elder Cunningham?!  That's Amazing!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Oh. Elder Price. Hey.

ELDER PRICE
Hey...

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
So did you find yourself a new companion?

ELDER PRICE
No. No, I'm sorry about that... But this is GREAT, Elder Cunningham! If you've got some eager followers we can really turn things around here. I think we should start preparing which verses to teach them…we can prep some exercises-

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Uh woa- woa- wait a minute. You LEFT me. Remember?

ELDER (JASON)
Elder Cunningham we must always work in PAIRS.

ELDER MCKINLEY
Give Elder Cunningham a break -- If it's working better this way, he can leave Elder Price out of it.

ELDER MCKINLEY
Now, how many of the people want to have follow up sessions?!
 

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Oh let's see... All of them!

ELDERS
All of them!/ Oh my Gosh! /Wow! /You're Amazing Elder Price!

ELDER CHURCH (BRIAN)
Do you think we might actually get a baptism out of this?

ELDER MCKINLEY
They always say you just need to get the FIRST BAPTISM and the others will follow!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Hold on, guys… Let's not get too carried away. I know I'm doing a real good job and all, but... I mean... Most of these people are scared of this General Butt F-ing Naked guy.

ELDER (SCOTT)
Well, somebody needs to tell that General Butt F-ing Naked that people should be free to do what they want!

ELDER MCKINLEY
Nobody is going to change how a crazy war lord thinks. That would take something INCREDIBLE.

ELDER PRICE SOMETHING... INCREDIBLE...
SOMETHING INCREDIBLE…

ELDER MCKINLEY
Well, look, let's just be happy that Elder Cunningham has some people interested.

ELDER PRICE
It's alright, guys! I've got everything under control!! I know what Heavenly Father wants from me now! This village is gonna be SAVED!

14a: “I BELIEVE”

ELDER PRICE EVER SINCE I WAS A CHILD
I TRIED TO BE THE BEST... SO WHAT HAPPENED?
MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS ALL SAID I WAS BLESSED....
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ALL SO EXCITING. TO BE TEACHING OF CHRIST ACROSS THE SEA. BUT I ALLOWED MY FAITH TO BE SHAKEN-
OH WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH ME?

I'VE ALWAYS LONGED TO HELP THE NEEDY. TO DO THE THINGS I'VE NEVER DARED. THIS WAS THE TIME FOR ME TO STEP UP.
SO THEN WHY WAS I SO SCARED?


A WARLORD WHO SHOOTS PEOPLE IN THE FACE. WHAT'S SO SCARY ABOUT THAT?
I MUST TRUST THAT MY LORD IS MIGHTIER – AND ALWAYS HAS MY BACK.
NOW I MUST BE COMPLETELY DEVOUT
I CAN'T HAVE EVEN ONE SHRED OF DOUBT!


I BELIEVE –
THAT THE LORD GOD CREATED THE UNIVERSE. I BELIEVE –
THAT HE SENT HIS ONLY SON TO DIE FOR MY SINS. AND I BELIEVE –
THAT ANCIENT JEWS BUILT BOATS AND SAILED TO AMERICA. I AM A MORMON, AND A MORMON JUST BELIEVES.


YOU CANNOT JUST BELIEVE PART-WAY. YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IN IT ALL.
MY PROBLEM WAS DOUBTING THE LORD'S WILL. INSTEAD OF STANDING TALL.
I CAN'T ALLOW MYSELF TO HAVE ANY DOUBT. IT'S TIME TO SET MY WORRIES FREE.
TIME TO SHOW THE WORLD WHAT ELDER PRICE IS ABOUT. AND SHARE THE POWER INSIDE OF ME!!!
 

 

I BELIEVE -
 
ELDER PRICE
 
CHORUS (OS VOCALS) AHHH...
 
THAT GOD HAS A PLAN FOR ALL OF US.
I BELIEVE -
THAT PLAN INVOLVES
ME GETTING MY OWN PLANET. AND I BELIEVE
THAT THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE CHURCH, THOMAS MONSON, SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO GOD.
I AM A MORMON AND, DANG IT, A MORMON JUST BELIEVES.

I KNOW THAT I MUST GO AND DO – THE THINGS MY GOD COMMANDS.

I REALIZE NOW WHY HE SENT ME HERE!


IF YOU ASK THE LORD IN FAITH HE WILL ALWAYS ANSWER YOU JUST BELIEVE
IN HIM AND HAVE NO FEAR
 


I BELIEVE AAHHH....


BELIEVE OHO...





A MORMAN JUST BELIEVES.


THINGS MY GOD COMMANDS AHHH! AHHH!


ALWAYS ANSWER YOU JUST BELIEVE
AND HAVE NO FEAR
 


GUARD (TOMMAR)
General! We have an intruder! He just walked right into camp!



 
ELDER PRICE I BELIEVE!!!!
 

AAHHH
 
CHORUS
 
THAT SATAN HAS A HOLD OF YOU. I BELIEVE!
THAT THE LORD GOD HAS SENT ME HERE!
AND I BELIEVE!
THAT IN 1978 GOD CHANGED HIS MIND ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE!!! YOU CAN BE A MORMON!
A MORMON WHO JUST BELIEVES.
 
SATAN HAS A HOLD I BELIEVE!
GOD HAS SENT ME HERE BELIEVE


BLACK PEOPLE!!!
YOU CAN BE A MORMON WHO JUST BELIEVES
 

GENERAL
The fuck is this?


 
ELDER PRICE AND NOW I CAN FEEL THE EXCITEMENT.
THIS IS THE MOMENT I WAS BORN TO DO.
AND I FEEL SO INCREDIBLE –
TO BE SHARING MY FAITH WITH YOU.
THE SCRIPTURES SAY IF YOU ASK IN FAITH,
IF YOU ASK GOD HIMSELF YOU'LL KNOW.
BUT YOU MUST ASK HIM WITHOUT ANY DOUBTS,
AND LET YOUR SPIRIT GROW! I BELIEVE!
THAT GOD LIVES ON A PLANET CALLED KOLOB!
 
CHORUS













LET YOUR SPIRIT GROW AAHHH
I BELIEVE
 

 
I BELIEVE!
THAT JESUS HAS HIS OWN PLANET AS WELL.
AND I BELIEVE
THAT THE GARDEN OF EDEN WAS IN JACKSON COUNTY MISSOURI.
IF YOU BELIEVE,
THE LORD WILL REVEAL IT.
AND YOU'LL KNOW IT'S ALL TRUE – YOU'LL JUST FEEL IT.
YOU’LL BE A MORMON!!!! AND BY GOSH –
A MORMON JUST BELIEVESSSSSS!!!! OH, I BELIEVE!
I BELIEVE!
 
BELIEVE...
HIS OWN PLANET AS WELL OOOO....









A MORMON JUST...
JUST BELIEVES
A MORMON JUST… BELIEVES!

16a: RIVER NEAR VILLAGE





ELDER CUNNINGHAM
And so, yeah, so then Christ said to the Nephites, 'be strong!' You know?! 'Just because Laminates got big death star weapons and stuff doesn't mean they should run your lives! There's more of you than there are of them, you know? You should always... stand up for yourselves, Christ said!

MIDALA (LAWRENCE)
Just like the way the Hobbits all stood up to Brigham Young’s killers!

EDLER CUNNINGHAM
Yes! Very good Midala! So the Nephites fought off the wicked Laminites and for punishment the Lord God turned the Laminites YELLOW!

UGANDAN (MAIA)
Ooh! Like the Chinese!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Right! Right! Okay, we should probably stop there for today. Hopefully we'll see everyone tomorrow?

UGANDANS
Okay! /Bye! /Thank you!

RANDOM UGANDAN (ASMERET)
The book is right. We must not fight amongst each other! The Chinese are the real problem!

MAFALA
I LOVE all these Mormon stories! They are so fucking weird!

DARLESIA
Elder Cunningham... I just want to say we are very happy Heavenly Father brought you here.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Oh... Wow... Thank you
 

NABULUNGI
I’ve never seen the people here so happy. Even Baba. You are amazing.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Oh well, I really haven't done that much...

NABULUNGI
But you have. I texted my friend the story you told us of Joseph Smith’s battle with diarrhea. And he said everybody in the village has read it! You are a great man.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
I... I kind of AM, huh?

NABULUNGI
Do you think we're good enough to join the Mormons? We have been trying very hard and we are ready to do whatever tasks you require of us!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
No. No. You don't understand, there's nothing they have to DO to become Mormon. We let anybody who wants to join up! So long as they're willing to commit to the church, then we can baptize them!

NABULUNGI
Well then - would you like to... Baptize me?

EDLER CUNNINGHAM
Yeah, sure! That would be great!

NABULUNGI
Okay, let's do it!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Wha- you mean right now?
 

NABULUNGI
Why not?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Well, I... To be honest I've... Never done it before.

NABULUNGI
That's okay - neither have I.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Oh yeah! Guess that's true!

NABULUNGI
Do you know HOW to baptize someone into the church?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Yeah, that’s something we study over and over at the Missionary Control Center.

NABULUNGI
Then please, Elder Cunningham, I want to be baptized. I swear to dedicate my life to the church.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Ha... Okay, just give me a second to get ready.

NABULUNGI
Okay, I will get ready too.






ELDER CUNNINGHAM I'M ABOUT TO DO IT FOR THE FIRST TIME.
AND I'M GONNA DO IT WITH A GIRL! A SPECIAL GIRL –
WHO MAKES MY HEART KIND OF FLUTTER MAKES MY EYES KIND OF BLUR –

CUNNINGHAM AND NABULUNGI
BAPTIZE HER/ME AGAIN.

CUNNINGHAM
Uh- I'm sorry I need another minute.

NABULUNGI NEVER KNOWN A BOY SO GENTLE. ONE LIKE HIM IS HARD TO FIND –
A SPECIAL KIND –
IT MAKES MY HEART KIND OF FLUTTER LIKE A MOTH IN A COCOON.
I HOPE HE GETS TO BAPTIZING ME SOON.
 
ELDER CUNNINGHAM I'M GONNA BAPTIZE YOU.
I'M THROUGH WITH ALL MY STALLING.

NABULUNGI YOU'RE GONNA BAPTIZE ME.
I'M READY TO LET YOU DO IT.

BOTH AND IT WILL SET US FREE.
IT’S TIME TO BE IMMERSED.
AND I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE MY FIRST.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Okay you ready?

NABULUNGI
I'm ready. So how do we do it?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Well I hold you like this-

NABULUNGI
Yeah?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM

ELDER PRICE
Hit me … Gimme another one. COME ON!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Elder Price? You alright?

ELDER PRICE
Well, well… If it isn’t the SUPER MORMON. Spreading “the word”?! Making more – BRAIN WASHED ZOMBIES?!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Elder Price, what happened to you?

ELDER PRICE
I WOKE UP, that’s what happened!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Of course you woke up; you drank twelve cups of coffee.

ELDER PRICE
You tell me how is it, huh?! How is it YOU converted ALL those people into Mormons!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
I don’t know. Once I baptized Nasonex the others just fell into place.
 



ELDER PRICE
You get everything you pray for. YOU’RE doing everything I was supposed to do. Doesn’t that seem a little telling to you?!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Telling of what?!

ELDER PRICE
The universe doesn’t work the way we were told! When I was nine years old... My family took a trip to Orlando, Florida. It was the most wonderful, most magical place I had ever seen. I said to myself "THIS is where I want to spend eternity!". My parents told me that if I made God proud, and did whatever the church asked, in the Latter Days I could have whatever I wanted. So I WORKED and I WORKED. And even when I studied Mormon stories and I thought, 'That doesn't make ANY SENSE', I KEPT WORKING because I was told ONE DAY -- I would get my reward!! Planet Orlando!
But what do I have now? I can’t even get a ticket home…

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Alright, uh look… The mission President is coming, and if I’m without my companion, well, you know that looks very bad. So if you could just…

ELDER PRICE
Oh THAT’S why you came!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
No! I CAME because I care and - -

ELDER PRICE
BULL POOP! That’s bull poop, Elder and you know it.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
I know we may not be the best companions. But if we can PLEASE just act LIKE we’re still together in front of the mission President, you can get your ticket home, I can get my medal and we never have to speak to each other again.

ELDER PRICE
FINE. But don’t TALK to me and DON’T touch me.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
FINE.
 

ELDER PRICE
FINE.

ORLANDO... ORLANDO...
I LOVED YOU ORLANDO. YOUR BRIGHT LIGHTS YOUR BIG DREAMS
YOUR PROMISES YOU COULDN'T KEEP. ORLANDO, ORLANDO,
WITHOUT YOU, ORLANDO. I'M JUST A GUY.
WHO WILL DIE.
AND NEVER GO BACK TO YOU.

SCENE 11





ELDER MCKINLEY
We are sorry, Mission President! We had no idea-

MISSION PRESIDENT (LEWIS)
YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! YOU'RE IN ENOUGH TROUBLE AS IT IS!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Sir, I was just trying to help the villagers! They all really wanted to learn…

NABULUNGI
Elder! ? Elder, I wanted to give you this! It’s the entire play written in text! What’s going on?

MISSION PRESIDENT
What's going on is you have all brought ridicule down onto the Latter Day Saints!

NABULUNGI
But we are ALL Latter Day Saints now, right?

MISSION PRESIDENT
YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE ARE ABOUT AS FAR FROM BEING LATTER DAY SAINTS AS IT GETS! YOU ALL ARE!

NABULUNGI
Elder Cunningham TELL THEM! We are ready to go to Sal Talelh Ka Siti! My things are packed!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
I'm so sorry Nabagamba -- I never meant that you were ACTUALLY going to Salt Lake City -


NABULUNGI
-But you said WE could find paradise by listening to you!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
When we say that, we mean paradise within YOURSELF - you know its sort of like a -- a Jesus thing.

NABULUNGI
Oh... I see... So when you baptized me. It meant nothing.
 

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
No, no, it meant EVERYTHING!

NABULUNGI
Everyone disobeyed the General because I told them to listen to you! Where are uncircumcised women supposed to go now?!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Wul no… We’re gonna stay here and help you, right. Right?

NABULUNGI
I KNOW what you people are now. You travel from your sparkling, lovely paradise in Utah to tell ridiculous stories to people less fortunate. To make fun of them.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
It isn't like that!

NABULUNGI
You have crushed my soul. I hope you all had a good laugh.


MISSION PRESIDENT
ELDERS! You may as well PACK YOUR THINGS. This district is SHUT DOWN. You’ll be given tickets home and you can explain to your parents that you have ALL FAILED as missionaries!
 
NABULUNGI
I'M SUCH A FOOL TO HAVE FOLLOWED THIS ADVICE. THERE IS NO TRIP TO PARADISE.
HOW COULD I LET MY HOPES GET SO HIGH...? HASA DIGA EEBOWAI!

HASA DEEGA EEBOWAI!
YOU GAVE ME A DREAM BUT IT WAS ALL A LIE. I THINK YOU LIKE TO SEE ME CRY...
HASA DIGA…

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Boy… I really did it this time, huh? I mean... I've always been a screw up but THIS –

ELDER PRICE
Joseph Smith dying of dysentery? Moroni from the Starship Enterprise? That play … was the most miraculous thing I’ve ever seen!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Huh?

ELDER PRICE
I mean, it was a bunch of made up stuff but it POINTED to something bigger, and you were the one -- wait a minute… You’ve been trying to teach me something all along haven’t you?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
What?

ELDER PRICE
I thought I could fly in here and change everything. But I made it all about ME. I was losing faith, but you went out and did--

SOMETHING INCREDIBLE.
YOU DID SOMETHING INCREDIBLE
FOR A PEOPLE WHO HAD NOWHERE LEFT TO GO I THOUGHT THEY WERE UNREACHABLE –
BUT THEY WERE HAPPY AND HOPEFUL AND WEARING COSTUMES IT WAS ALMOST LIKE...
ORLANDO...

I’m sorry it took me so long to realize what you were trying to teach me, Elder.
 
ELDER CUNNINGHAM
But what about Nordstrom! I – I made her believe in a bunch of made up crap!

ELDER PRICE
It doesn’t matter if the stories are made up or not. That isn’t the point…


ELDER CUNNINGHAM
No, it doesn’t MATTER now cuz she’s gonna get her clit cut off and it’s all my fault!


ELDER PRICE
No we cannot give up hope, Elder! We have to try to FIX THIS!
 

SCENE 12







MAFALA
So what did the Mormons president think of our play?

MUTUMBO (JOHN ERIC)
Did Elder Cunningham like it?


GENERAL
JUMAMOSI!!!!!

UGANDANS
(Screaming)

GENERAL
There have been RUMORS, that the people of this village are uniting to oppose me.

UGANDAN MAN (JOHN ERIC)
Yes we have been shown another way!

NABULUNGI
No! …NO! We do not oppose you… We will do whatever you say.

UGANDAN (JOHN ERIC)
Nabulungi, our prophet has taught us to stick together and FIGHT oppression!

NABULUNGI
Forget about Elder Cunningham. You aren’t going to see him ever again.

MIDDALA (LAWRENCE)
What?! Why not?
 
NABULUNGI
Because Elder Cunningham… he was eaten by lions alright?

UGANDANS
Lions? What? Our prophet was eaten by lions?

GENERAL
ENOUGH! There is ONE LAW you will obey here, and it is MINE!

UGANDAN (LAWRENCE)
We believe in something ELSE!

NABULUNGI
STOP IT ALL OF YOU! I told you our prophet is gone! There is no promised land. There is no salvation.


DARLESIA
You must not talk like that Nabulungi. Remember the teachings of the first Mormons when Joseph Smith died they did not give up on their hope.


NABULUNGI
But it's not TRUE. We aren't going to Salt Lake City.


KIMBAY(REMA)
Nabulungi, Salt Lake City isn't an actual PLACE... It's an IDEA. A metaphor.

MAFALA
You need to remember that Prophets always speak in metaphors.

ASMERET
Yeah, you don't think a man ACTUALLY fucked a frog do you? That's fucking stupid.


NABULUNGI
And you all believe this?


ALL
YES!!!
 
ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Excuse me , everyone --

UGANDANS
(GASP)

LAWRENCE
He is risen!

MAIA
It is a miracle!

MAFALA
Our prophet returns even from dead! (to the General) THERE YOU SEE!?

ASMERET
He must have fucked a frog!

GENERAL
Who has risen from the dead?!

ELDER PRICE
HE HAS, you IDIOT! So you might as well just PUT THAT GUN DOWN BECAUSE IT WILL NOT WORK AGAINST THE UNDEAD. And if you do not get OUT of this village right now he is gonna command The Angel Moroni, on the death star, to unleash Kraken! Which will then… Which will then…

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Which will then – launch Joseph Smith torpedoes FROM its mouth of Christ and turn you into a LESBIAN!

UGANDANS
ALRIGHT! /YEAH!/WE DID IT

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Oh, Nala, I am so sorry. But please if you just give me a chance -

NABULUNGI
Elder, its okay… I understand now what you have been trying to teach me all along.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
Oh okay. Great.
 
ELDER PRICE
Woa- Woa Elders where do you think you are going?

ELDER MCKINLEY
What do you mean 'where are we going'?  We've been shut down!

ELDER NEELEY (KEVIN)
Yeah we have to go home!

ELDER PRICE
Who says we have to?

ELDER ZELDER (JUSTIN)
What?

ELDER PRICE
Look, we all wanted to go on a mission so we could spend two years of our lives helping people out?! So let's DO it!

ELDER NEELEY (KEVIN)
But the Mission President said we're all as far from latter day saints as it gets!

ELDER PRICE
No... You know what guys? FUCK HIM. We are STILL Latter Day Saints. ALL of us. Even if we change some things, or we break the rules, or we have complete doubt that God exists... We can still all work together and make THIS our paradise planet.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM
You wanna stay here with me?

ELDER PRICE
I’d do anything for you. I’m your best friend.
